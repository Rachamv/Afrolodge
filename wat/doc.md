The relationships between the `User`, `City`, `Place`, `Amenity`, `Review`, and `State` tables can be described as follows:

1. **User - Place Relationship:**
   - Each user can be associated with multiple places (listings) that they own.
   - The `User` table has a one-to-many relationship with the `Place` table, where one user can have multiple places, but each place is associated with only one user.

2. **City - Place Relationship:**
   - Each place is associated with a specific city.
   - The `City` table and the `Place` table have a many-to-one relationship, where many places can be located in the same city, but each place is associated with only one city.

3. **Place - Amenity Relationship:**
   - Each place can have multiple amenities.
   - The `Place` table and the `Amenity` table have a many-to-many relationship, where each place can have multiple amenities, and each amenity can be associated with multiple places.

4. **Place - Review Relationship:**
   - Each place can have multiple reviews.
   - The `Place` table and the `Review` table have a one-to-many relationship, where one place can have multiple reviews, but each review is associated with only one place.

5. **Review - User Relationship:**
   - Each review is associated with a specific user (author).
   - The `Review` table has a many-to-one relationship with the `User` table, where many reviews can be authored by the same user, but each review is associated with only one user.

6. **Review - Place Relationship:**
   - Each review is associated with a specific place.
   - The `Review` table and the `Place` table have a many-to-one relationship, where many reviews can be associated with the same place, but each review is associated with only one place.

7. **State - City Relationship:**
   - Each city is located in a specific state.
   - The `State` table and the `City` table have a one-to-many relationship, where one state can have multiple cities, but each city is associated with only one state.

These relationships provide the necessary connections between different entities in the database, allowing for efficient querying and retrieval of related information.
The relationships between the tables can be defined as follows:

1. **User and Review Relationship:**
   - `User` and `Review` have a one-to-many relationship, where one user can have multiple reviews, but each review is associated with only one user.
   - This relationship is established through the `author_id` foreign key in the `Review` table referencing the `id` primary key in the `User` table.

2. **Place and Review Relationship:**
   - `Place` and `Review` have a one-to-many relationship, where one place can have multiple reviews, but each review is associated with only one place.
   - This relationship is established through the `place_id` foreign key in the `Review` table referencing the `id` primary key in the `Place` table.

3. **City and Place Relationship:**
   - `City` and `Place` have a one-to-many relationship, where one city can have multiple places, but each place is associated with only one city.
   - This relationship is implicit through the `location` column in the `Place` table, which stores the name of the city.

4. **State and City Relationship:**
   - `State` and `City` have a one-to-many relationship, where one state can have multiple cities, but each city is associated with only one state.
   - This relationship is established through the `state` column in the `City` table, which stores the name of the state.

5. **State and Place Relationship:**
   - `State` and `Place` have a one-to-many relationship, where one state can have multiple places, but each place is associated with only one state.
   - This relationship is established through the `location` column in the `Place` table, which stores the name of the state.

6. **Amenity and Place Relationship:**
   - `Amenity` and `Place` have a many-to-many relationship, where one amenity can be associated with multiple places, and one place can have multiple amenities.
   - This relationship is typically implemented through a separate table (junction table) that stores pairs of `Amenity` and `Place` relationships.

Note: The exact relationship implementation for the many-to-many relationship between `Amenity` and `Place` depends on the specific requirements and design preferences.

# Database Development Tutorial for Beginners

## Introduction

Welcome to this beginner-friendly tutorial on database development using Python and SQLite. In this tutorial, we'll guide you through the process of creating and interacting with a simple database that represents a system for managing states, cities, places, amenities, reviews, and users.

### Prerequisites

Before we begin, ensure that you have Python installed on your system. Additionally, you'll need to understand the basics of Python programming.

## Setting Up the Database

### 1. State Database Table

```python
# states.py

from ..services.db_connection import connect_to_database

with connect_to_database() as (conn, cursor):
    cursor.execute("""
        CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS states (
            id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
            name TEXT NOT NULL UNIQUE,
            country TEXT NOT NULL
        )
    """)

def create_state(name, country):
    """Adds a new state to the database."""
    with connect_to_database() as (conn, cursor):
        cursor.execute("""
            INSERT INTO states (name, country)
            VALUES (?, ?)
        """, (name, country))
        conn.commit()

def get_state_details(state_id):
    """Retrieves details about a specific state."""
    with connect_to_database() as (conn, cursor):
        cursor.execute("SELECT * FROM states WHERE id=?", (state_id,))
        state_data = cursor.fetchone()
    return state_data

def delete_state(state_id):
    """Removes a state and its associated data (if any)."""
    with connect_to_database() as (conn, cursor):
        cursor.execute("DELETE FROM states WHERE id=?", (state_id,))
        conn.commit()
```

Explanation:

- The `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` statement ensures that the "states" table is created only if it doesn't already exist.
- `create_state`: Adds a new state to the database.
- `get_state_details`: Retrieves details about a specific state.
- `delete_state`: Removes a state and its associated data.

### 2. City Database Table

class City:
    def __init__(self, name, state, country):
        self.name = name
        self.state = state
        self.country = country

    def create_city(self):
        with connect_to_database() as (conn, cursor):
            cursor.execute('''
                CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS cities (
                    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
                    name TEXT NOT NULL,
                    state TEXT NOT NULL,

                )
            ''')
            cursor.execute('''
                INSERT INTO cities (name, state, country)
                VALUES (?, ?, ?)
            ''', (self.name, self.state, self.country))
            conn.commit()

    def get_city_details(self, city_id):
        with connect_to_database() as (conn, cursor):
            cursor.execute('''
                SELECT * FROM cities
                WHERE id = ?
            ''', (city_id,))
            city_data = cursor.fetchone()
        return city_data

    def delete_city(self, city_id):
        with connect_to_database() as (conn, cursor):

                DELETE FROM cities
                WHERE id = ?
            ''', (city_id,))
            conn.commit()

        cursor.execute(update_query, list(kwargs.values()) + [place_id])
        conn.commit()

def delete_place(place_id):
    """Removes a place listing."""
    with connect_to_database() as (conn, cursor):
        cursor.execute("DELETE FROM places WHERE id=?", (place_id,))
        conn.commit()

def user_add_place(user_id, title, description, location, price, amenities, photos, availability_calendar):
    """Allows a user to add their place for listing."""
    create_place(title, description, location, price, amenities, photos, availability_calendar, user_id, [])

            name TEXT NOT NULL UNIQUE,
            description TEXT
        )
    """)

def create_amenity(name, description):
    """Adds a new amenity to the database."""
    with connect_to_database() as (conn, cursor):
        cursor.execute("""
            INSERT INTO Amenity (name, description)
            VALUES (?, ?)
        """, (name, description))
        conn.commit()

def get_amenity_details(amenity_id):
    """Retrieves details about a specific amenity."""
    with connect_to_database() as (conn, cursor):
        cursor.execute("SELECT * FROM Amenity WHERE id=?", (amenity_id,))
        amenity_data = cursor.fetchone()
    return amenity_data

def delete_amenity(amenity_id):
    """Removes an amenity from the system."""
    with connect_to_database() as (conn, cursor):
        cursor.execute("DELETE FROM Amenity WHERE id

=?", (amenity_id,))
        conn.commit()
```

Explanation:

- The `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` statement ensures that the "Amenity" table is created only if it doesn't already exist.
- `create_amenity`: Adds a new amenity to the database.
- `get_amenity_details`: Retrieves details about a specific amenity.
- `delete_amenity`: Removes an amenity from the system.

### 5. Review Database Table

```python
# review.py

from ..services.db_connection import connect_to_database

with connect_to_database() as (conn, cursor):
    cursor.execute("""
        CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS Review (
            id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
            content TEXT NOT NULL,
            rating INTEGER NOT NULL,
            author_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
            place_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
            FOREIGN KEY (author_id) REFERENCES User(id),
            FOREIGN KEY (place_id) REFERENCES Place(id)
        )
    """)

def create_review(content, rating, author_id, place_id):
    """Adds a new review to the database."""
    with connect_to_database() as (conn, cursor):
        cursor.execute("""
            INSERT INTO Review (content, rating, author_id, place_id)
            VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?)
        """, (content, rating, author_id, place_id))
        conn.commit()

def get_place_reviews(place_id):
    """Retrieves reviews for a specific place."""
    with connect_to_database() as (conn, cursor):
        cursor.execute("SELECT * FROM Review WHERE place_id=?", (place_id,))
        reviews = cursor.fetchall()
    return reviews

def delete_review(review_id):
    """Removes a user's review."""
    with connect_to_database() as (conn, cursor):
        cursor.execute("DELETE FROM Review WHERE id=?", (review_id,))
        conn.commit()
```

Explanation:

- The `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` statement ensures that the "Review" table is created only if it doesn't already exist.
- `create_review`: Adds a new review to the database.
- `get_place_reviews`: Retrieves reviews for a specific place.
- `delete_review`: Removes a user's review.

### 6. User Database Table

```python
# user.py

from ..services.db_connection import connect_to_database

class User:
    def __init__(self, email, password, name, profile_picture=None):
        self.email = email
        self.password = password
        self.name = name
        self.profile_picture = profile_picture

    def create_user(self):
        with connect_to_database() as (conn, cursor):
            cursor.execute("""
                CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS users (
                    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
                    email TEXT UNIQUE NOT NULL,
                    password TEXT NOT NULL,
                    name TEXT NOT NULL,
                    profile_picture TEXT
                )
            """)
            cursor.execute("INSERT INTO users (email, password, name, profile_picture) VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?)",
                           (self.email, self.password, self.name, self.profile_picture))
            conn.commit()

    @classmethod
    def authenticate_user(cls, email, password):
        with connect_to_database() as (cursor):
            cursor.execute("SELECT * FROM users WHERE email=? AND password=?", (email, password))
            user_data = cursor.fetchone()
            if user_data:
                return cls(*user_data)  # Create a User instance from fetched data
            return None

    def update_user(self):
        with connect_to_database() as (conn, cursor):
            cursor.execute("UPDATE users SET name=?, profile_picture=? WHERE email=?",
                           (self.name, self.profile_picture, self.email))
            conn.commit()

    def delete_user(self):
        with connect_to_database() as (conn, cursor):
            cursor.execute("DELETE FROM users WHERE email=?", (self.email,))
            conn.commit()
```

Explanation:

- `User` class represents a user with attributes email, password, name, and profile picture.
- `create_user`: Creates the "users" table if it doesn't exist and inserts a new user into the database.
- `authenticate_user`: Authenticates a user based on email and password.
- `update_user`: Updates user information.
- `delete_user`: Deletes a user from the database based on email.
